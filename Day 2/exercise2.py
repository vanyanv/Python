# Exercise 2 - BMI Calculator
# Overview
# My Submissions/Test Runs
# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# bmi = weight(kg)/height**2(m^2)

# Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

# Example Input
# weight = 80
# height = 1.75
# Example Output
# 80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
# 26


height = input("enter your height: ")
weight = input("enter your weight: ")

height = float(height)
weight = float(weight)

bmi = weight/(height ** 2)
print(int(bmi))
