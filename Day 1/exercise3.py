# Exercise 3 - Input Function
# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

# e.g.

# Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

#first ask user their name and store it in a variable called name
name = input("What is your name?")
#use the build in function len for strings which returns a number
print(len(name))
